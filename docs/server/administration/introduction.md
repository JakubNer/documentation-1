This tutorial will guide you through the necessary steps required to run the operational components for executing atomic swaps on your local environment.

An instance of the UI and agent configured for the bitcoin and ethereum testnets has been setup [here](https://liquality.io/swap-testnet-dev/) for convenience. 

The components covered will include the liquality [swap user interface](https://github.com/liquality/liquality-swap), and an optional [automated agent](https://github.com/liquality/agent). 

The swap interface is a functional reference implementation that facilitates the workflow between two anonymous parties wishing to swap digital assets with minimized counter party risk. The automated agent can be thought of a as a back-office system for those wishing to enable an automated market making system which is complimentary, but independent from the user interface.
