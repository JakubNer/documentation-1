# Swap run through steps

Here we cover the steps required to execute a swap using the liquality swap interface. These steps should be executed before committing changes to the master branch of the [liquality-swap](https://github.com/liquality/liquality-swap) repository.

# Prerequisite

Before executing a swap you will need access to the following

1. Access to an instance of the swap interface
> For convenience, we have an example swap interface up and running at [https://liquality.io/swap/](https://liquality.io/swap/). You are also welcome to spin up your own instance by visiting our github repo at [https://github/liquality/liquality-swap/](https://github/liquality/liquality-swap/)
2. Access to a [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) with a sufficient balance of *bitcoin* required for the swap
3. Access to [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) with a sufficient balance of *ether* required for the swap
4. A counter party (person you are looking to swap with) that also meets the requirements set out here. Your counter party will need to provide you with their preferred addresses, and terms for the assets you are looking to swap.


## Initiating a swap (Party A) - Swap Initiation



1. Access the swap user interface
> Visit [our demonstration swap interface](https://liquality.io)

## Confirming the terms for a swap (Party B) - Counter parties agree

![Swap Initiation](../assets/confirm_1.png)
2. Review the terms of the Swap
> Confirm that you are in agreement with the terms set out by the initiator of the swap. These terms include the "Want" and "Have" assets, their respective values and the rate at which they are to be swapped. There is also information regarding the duration for which the swap is still valid.
3. Connect you wallets
> We currently only include support for two assets, nl. bitcoin and ether. Each asset is limited to a set of wallets including ledger (for bitcoin) and metamask (ether)
![Swap Initiation](../assets/confirm_2.png)
4. Select the *Confirm Terms* option
> Select this option if you are happy with the terms of this swap. Alternatively, initiate a swap with the revised terms and send the link to the counter party, or ask them to re-configured these terms based on the preferred values.
> Note: It might be undesirable to renogitiate these terms considering that the initiator has already locked up the funds for the initial terms of the contract.
