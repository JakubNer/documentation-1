# Introduction

The bitcoin wallet api allows web applications to be built that interact with user wallets. The first implementation of the API is [Liquality Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liquality-wallet/kpfopkelmapcoipemfendmdcghnegimn?hl=en).

As a Bitcoin user, you can carry your wallet across applications as a form of identity and as a means to have a more usable experience using your Bitcoin.
